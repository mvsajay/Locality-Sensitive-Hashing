# my-first-project
This project works on a random dataset(which is randomly created in program) to find 10 nearest  neighbours to given point with in 1sec
I used locality sensitvity hashing to find 10 nearest neighbours
Locality sensitvity hashing is a probablistic algorithm,so we cant get accurate results and results vary on each iteration
