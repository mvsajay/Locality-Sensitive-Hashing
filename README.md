# my-first-project
This project works on a random dataset(which is randomly created in program) to find 10 nearest  neighbours to given point with in 1sec(to get 10 nearest neighbours given dataset and query point)
I used locality sensitve hashing to find 10 nearest neighbours
Locality sensitvity hashing is a probablistic algorithm,so we cant get accurate results and results vary on each iteration
I ensured correctness by comparing it with bruteforce
I used python  version 3.6 as programming language
